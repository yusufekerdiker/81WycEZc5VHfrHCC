Hello, I am Yusuf Ekerdiker. First of all, I apologize for sending my reply late. To do anything with the Twitter
API, you need to apply as a developer and get keys and tokens. Twitter support took longer than I expected as it
gave me trouble trying to get the developer title.

This repository contains the codes and results requested for the Ignite program. The ACME.ipynb file is my main file
where I write my codes. The codes in the first cell, the libraries I need, the keys and tokens required to run the
codes, the lists required to store the data, the search query, the part where I add the data from the loop to the
lists, the bonus part, the part where I create data-frames with the data in the lists, the part where I corrected a
few errors and finally The part where I convert the data-frame into a CSV file with this data (twitter-query.csv).

Second cell, I took this converted CSV file and made a simple html file named csv-table.html.

The third cell is the part where I try to learn the API and explore the functions.

The table.html was the part where I made the data I got from csv-table.html into a complete html file and made it a
little more organized and readable by adding CSS. However, I could not succeed in this because the parts I converted
the data from Twitter to CSV and then to HTML completely cleared the contents of the file and rewrote the data.
However, I kept it as a template.
